## Charsiu: A transformer-based phonetic aligner [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03876)

### Updates
- 2.10.2022. We release phone- and word-level alignments for 860k utterances from the English subset of Common Voice. Check out [this link](misc/data.md#alignments-for-english-datasets).  
- 1.31.2022. We release phone- and word-level alignments for over a million Mandarin utterances. Check out [this link](misc/data.md#alignments-for-mandarin-speech-datasets).  
- 1.26.2022. Word alignment functionality has been added to `charsiu_forced_aligner` .

### Intro
**Charsiu** is a phonetic alignment tool, which can:
- recognise phonemes in a given audio file
- perform forced alignment using phone transcriptions created in the previous step or provided by the user.
- directly predict the phone-to-audio alignment from audio (text-independent alignment)  

The aligner is under active development. New functions, new languages and detailed documentation will be added soon! Give us a star if you like our project!  
**Fun fact**: Char Siu is one of the most representative dishes of Cantonese cuisine 🍲 (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_siu)).

### Tutorial 
**[!NEW]** A step-by-step tutorial for linguists: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lingjzhu/charsiu/blob/development/charsiu_tutorial.ipynb)

You can directly run our model in the cloud via Google Colab!

 - Textless alignment: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lingjzhu/charsiu/blob/development/charsiu_textless_demo.ipynb)  

### Usage
```
git clone  https://github.com/lingjzhu/charsiu
cd charsiu
```
#### Forced alignment
```Python
from Charsiu import charsiu_forced_aligner
# if there are errors importing, uncomment the following lines and add path to charsiu
# import sys
# sys.path.append('path_to_charsiu/src')

# initialize model
charsiu = charsiu_forced_aligner(aligner='charsiu/en_w2v2_fc_10ms')
# perform forced alignment
alignment = charsiu.align(audio='./local/SA1.WAV',
                          text='She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.')
# perform forced alignment and save the output as a textgrid file
charsiu.serve(audio='./local/SA1.WAV',
              text='She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.',
              save_to='./local/SA1.TextGrid')


# Chinese
charsiu = charsiu_forced_aligner(aligner='charsiu/zh_w2v2_tiny_fc_10ms',lang='zh')
charsiu.align(audio='./local/SSB00050015_16k.wav',text='经广州日报报道后成为了社会热点。')
charsiu.serve(audio='./local/SSB00050015_16k.wav', text='经广州日报报道后成为了社会热点。',
              save_to='./local/SSB00050015.TextGrid')
              
# An numpy array of speech signal can also be passed to the model.
import soundfile as sf
y, sr = sf.read('./local/SSB00050015_16k.wav')
charsiu.align(audio=y,text='经广州日报报道后成为了社会热点。')
```


#### Textless alignment
```Python
from Charsiu import charsiu_predictive_aligner
# English
# initialize a model
charsiu = charsiu_predictive_aligner(aligner='charsiu/en_w2v2_fc_10ms')
# perform textless alignment
alignment = charsiu.align(audio='./local/SA1.WAV')
# Or
# perform textless alignment and output the results to a textgrid file
charsiu.serve(audio='./local/SA1.WAV', save_to='./local/SA1.TextGrid')


# Chinese
charsiu = charsiu_predictive_aligner(aligner='charsiu/zh_xlsr_fc_10ms',lang='zh')

charsiu.align(audio='./local/SSB16240001_16k.wav')
# Or
charsiu.serve(audio='./local/SSB16240001_16k.wav', save_to='./local/SSB16240001.TextGrid')
```

* That you understand that this tool is a work in progress which may contain bugs.  Future versions will be released, and bug fixes (and additions) will not necessarily be advertised.

* That this tool may break with future updates of the various dependencies, and that the authors are not required to repair the package when that happens.

* That you understand that the authors are not required or necessarily available to fix bugs which are encountered (although you're welcome to submit bug reports to Jian Zhu (lingjzhu@umich.edu), if needed), nor to modify the tool to your needs.

* That you will acknowledge the authors of the tool if you use, modify, fork, or re-use the code in your future work.  

* That rather than re-distributing this tool to other researchers, you will instead advise them to download the latest version from the website.

... and, most importantly:

* That neither the authors, our collaborators, nor the the University of Michigan or any related universities on the whole, are responsible for the results obtained from the proper or improper usage of the tool, and that the tool is provided as-is, as a service to our fellow linguists.
