# Forced-aligned Speech Datasets

Here we release **TextGrids** for several datasets that have been forced aligned with [Charsiu Forced Aligner](https://github.com/lingjzhu/charsiu). Hoepfully they might be helpful for your research. 
Forced alignment does not generate perfect alignments. **Use at you own discrection**.

## Alignments for English datasets

### Textgrids
You can find [all textgrids for the trianing set (~860k utterances) in this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IF0WB5-8VXfaENtE4r5rehHHK8YFe61S?usp=sharing). It contains phone- and word-level alignments for the English subset of Common Voice (~2000 hours). It was aligned with `charsiu_forced_aligner` with the model `charsiu/en_w2v2_fc_10ms`. 
All filenames are matched. Only a few mismatched samples were discarded. 

### Audio
You can find the dataset at the [Common Voice Project](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).  

The audio data can also be easily accessed through [the Common Voce page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_8_0) at HuggingFace hub. An account is needed for authentication.
```
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_8_0", "en", split='train',use_auth_token=True)
```
Note that ~80GB of memory is needed to load the dataset into memory.

Please cite Common Voice if you use this dataset.

## Alignments for Mandarin Speech datasets

This repository contains phone- and word-level alignments for multiple Mandarin Chinese speech datasets, including MagicData (~755 hours), Aishell-1 (~150 hours), STCMDS (~100 hours), Datatang (~200 hours), THCHS-30 (~30 hours) and PrimeWords (~100 hours).

### Textgrids
You can download all textgrids [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IF0WB5-8VXfaENtE4r5rehHHK8YFe61S?usp=sharing). The forced alignment was done with `charsiu_forced_aligner` using model `charsiu/zh_xlsr_fc_10ms`. Only Praat textgrid files are distributed. Sentences with Englist letters and numbers were all removed. Misaligned files were also discarded. 

The grapheme-to-phoneme conversion was done automatically with [`g2pM`](https://github.com/kakaobrain/g2pM).
